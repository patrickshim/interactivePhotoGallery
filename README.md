# Interactive Photo Gallery

Description: For this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using Javascript and CSS Grid layout. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions. At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be "back" and "previous" arrows to cycle through photos.

Skills Used: HTML, CSS(Grid) & Javascript
